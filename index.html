        <h1> Habit stacking</h1>
        <p> Habit stacking is a productivity and behavior change technique that involves linking new habits to existing
            ones to create a structured routine. </p>
        <p> To implement habit stacking, individuals identify a current habit they perform consistently, such as
            brushing teeth or making coffee, and pair it with a new habit they want to establish, like doing push-ups or
            meditating. This method capitalizes on the brain's tendency to rely on cues and patterns, making it easier
            to integrate new habits into daily life.

            The key to successful habit stacking lies in simplicity and consistency. Start with small adjustments and
            gradually add more habits over time. Additionally, it's essential to choose habits that complement each
            other and fit well into the existing routine. By strategically layering new behaviors onto familiar ones,
            habit stacking can lead to significant and lasting personal development. <br> <b>~ by James Clear</b> <a
